There are two files, one that acts as a simple shell, and the other of which exercises the handling of several different signals. More specifically, the second program will use the Monte Carlo method to estimate what fraction of the total address space is inaccessible, by attempting to access random locations and reporting what fraction of attempts are unsuccessful.


How to run the program:
1.type in make
2. run ./shell (give parameter)
3. inside shell do ./friendship (give aprameter for timer)
4. Enjoy!
